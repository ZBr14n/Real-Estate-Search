# Real-Estate-Search
Inspired by Trulia and Zillow real-estate portal, I created my own minimalistic website for filtering housing data.

https://real-estate-search.now.sh/

# What I learned:

Using React.js framework with Hooks, I was able to utilize the filter(), sort(), and map() functions to filter housing data in the JSON object.

# What can be improved in future commits:

1. Create user favorites for a list(s) of houses.
2. Add more images.
3. Extend Google Map API to this project.
